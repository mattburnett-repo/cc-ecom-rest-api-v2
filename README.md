# E-Commerce REST API project
This is a collection of RESTful API calls modelled on basic e-commerce functionality.

The focus of this project is the creation of REST APIs, and not the creation of a functioning online store.

Click the 'Deployment' link to go to the app. From there you can register / login, and then see the API specification.
All API routes are protected by authentication.

## Technologies used
* Express / NodeJS
* PostgreSQL / PGadmin / Postbird
* Mocha / Chai TDD suite
* Postman API development tool
* bcrypt encryption library
* Passport JS authentication library
* Swagger API documentation
* Heroku deployment platform

## Future development / To do
* Everything can always be better...
* Use loaders to make the app.js file smaller / more modularity of the app.
* Better integration with Swagger. Make api-docs more interactive, allow users to run APIs from the api docs.
  * Maybe this can be found in the OpenAPI docs / process
* More granular control over api access using existing authentication
