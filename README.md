# E-Commerce REST API project
This is a collection of RESTful API calls modelled on basic e-commerce functionality.

The focus of this project is the creation of REST APIs, and not the creation of a functioning online store.

Click the 'Deployment' link to go to the app. From there you can register / login, and then see the API specification.
All API routes are protected by authentication.
